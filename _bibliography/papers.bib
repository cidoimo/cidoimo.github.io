   abstract={Desert strains of the genus Chroococcidiopsis are among the most desiccation-resistant cyanobacteria capable of anhydrobiosis. The accumulation of two sugars, sucrose and trehalose, facilitates the entrance of anhydrobiotes into a reversible state of dormancy by stabilizing cellular components upon water removal. This study aimed to evaluate, at the atomistic level, the role of trehalose in desiccation resistance by using as a model system the 30S ribosomal subunit of the desert cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis sp. 029. Molecular dynamic simulations provided atomistic evidence regarding its protective role on the 30S molecular structure. Trehalose forms an enveloping shell around the ribosomal subunit and stabilizes the structures through a network of direct interactions. The simulation confirmed that trehalose actively interacts with the 30S ribosomal subunit and that, by replacing water molecules, it ensures ribosomal structural integrity during desiccation, thus enabling protein synthesis to be carried out upon rehydration.}
